Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction.
 It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.
 Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity,
 both up and down, as your computing requirements change. Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for 
 capacity that you actually use.
 Amazon EC2 provides developers the tools to build failure resilient applications and isolate them from common failure scenarios.
